## Project Overview & Live Demo
- **Enhanced BMI Calculator:** An interactive tool to calculate your BMI and understand your health status.
- **Live App:** [Visit the App](http://bharat2369.shinyapps.io/BMIAPPUPDATED/)
- **Source Code:** Available on GitHub: [https://github.com/Bharat2369/bmi-app](https://github.com/Bharat2369/bmi-app)

## Problem & Motivation
- **Health Context:**  
  - Obesity and underweight issues are rising.
  - BMI is a simple but often misunderstood measure of health.
- **Challenge:**  
  - Many find it hard to quickly assess their BMI without guidance.
- **Our Solution:**  
  - A self-assessment tool with clear visuals and step-by-step instructions.

## Key Features & User Experience
- **User Inputs:**  
  - Weight (kg) and Height (cm) via numeric inputs.
  - A button to trigger the calculation.
- **Reactive Output:**  
  - Calculates and displays BMI along with a health category.
  - Dynamic visualization to show progress within BMI ranges.
- **Documentation:**  
  - In-app “Documentation” and “About” tabs to help even novice users.

## Technical Implementation
```{r, echo=TRUE}
# Example BMI Calculation:
weight <- 70                      # weight in kg
height_m <- 170 / 100             # height in meters (converted)
bmi_value <- weight / (height_m^2)
bmi_value <- round(bmi_value, 2)
bmi_value
